## Diabetes Prediction: Project Overview

* Created a model to help predict if an individual has diabetes or not using Random Forest and the evaluation metric as Recall Score (recall_score = .9883)
* Cleaned the dataset and handled missing values with variety of techniques
* Optimized Random Forest model with hyperparameter tuning using RandomSearchCV to obtain the best parametes
* Create an API with the help of the Streamlit library and deployed the model to Heroku
